## 1. Introduction
GitLab Flow is a simple and practical way to manage code using Git. It helps teams work together smoothly and ensures that all code changes are reviewed and tested before deployment. This workflow supports CI/CD and helps deliver stable software faster.

---
## 2. What GitLab Flow
GitLab Flow is a simple way to manage code changes using Git. Developers work on small feature branches, get their changes reviewed, and use automated tests before merging code into the main branch. This process helps teams work together smoothly, avoid mistakes, and release software faster and more safely.

## 3. Why GitLab Flow
GitLab Flow is used to keep development structured and easy to manage. It avoids complex branching and reduces mistakes during releases. This flow allows teams to deploy changes frequently while maintaining code quality and control.

## 4. Workflow Overview

### How It Works
- A developer creates a feature branch from the main branch  
- Code changes are committed to the feature branch  
- A Merge Request (MR) is raised  
- Automated tests run through CI pipelines  
- Code is reviewed and approved  
- Changes are merged into the main branch  
- Code is deployed to staging or production
