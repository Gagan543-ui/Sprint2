## 1. Introduction  
DevOps repositories are used to store and manage all code, configurations, and files needed for building, testing, and deploying applications. These repositories help teams work together in an organized way using a version control system (VCS).

---

## 2. What is a DevOps Repository  
A DevOps repository is a central place in a version control system where teams store application code, infrastructure files, configurations, and automation scripts. It helps manage changes and keeps everything in one controlled location.

## 3. Why DevOps Repositories Are Needed  
DevOps repositories are needed to maintain consistency, track changes, and enable teamwork. They help development and operations teams work together smoothly and reduce errors during deployment.

## 4. Types of DevOps Repositories  

- **Application Code Repository**  
  Stores the main source code of the application.

- **Infrastructure Repository**  
  Stores infrastructure-related files like servers and cloud setup.
